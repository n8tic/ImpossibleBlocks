# Impossible Blocks

A unique puzzle game where blocks move horizontally and strategy meets challenge! Unlike traditional block-falling games, Impossible Blocks features innovative horizontal movement and special pattern mechanics.

## Game Rules

### Core Mechanics
1. **Movement Direction**: Unlike traditional Tetris, blocks move from left to right
2. **Grid Size**: The game is played on a 12x36 grid (height x width)
3. **Game Over**: The game ends if any block reaches the leftmost side of the grid
4. **Block Types**: Uses unique pentomino shapes (5 blocks each) with different patterns:
   - Alternating Pattern (A): [1,0,1,0,1] and [0,1,0,1,0]
   - Zigzag (B): A 3x3 zigzag shape
   - Corner Block (C): An L-shaped corner piece
   - Plus Shape (D): A cross/plus shaped piece
   - H Shape (E): An H-shaped configuration
   - Reversed Corner (F): A reversed L-shaped piece
   - Snake Shape (G): A snake-like pattern

### Scoring System
1. **Basic Points**
   - Each Block: 100 points
   - 5 Vertical Blocks: 1000 points + Block Points
   - 2x2 Square Pattern: 500 points
   - Cross Shape Pattern: 1000 points

2. **Multipliers**
   - Level Bonus: Score × (1 + Level × 0.5)
   - Perfect Clear: Triple Score (3x multiplier)

3. **Leveling**
   - Every 8 lines cleared increases your level
   - Higher levels mean faster block movement
   - Level multiplier increases your score
